Hello! I'm Bazlur, a Software Engineer with over a decade of professional experience in the software industry, primarily focused on Java and related technologies. I was recently honored with the title of [Java Champion](https://twitter.com/Java_Champions/status/1523728715368509440).

Beyond my regular work, I am passionate about mentoring, writing, speaking at conferences, and contributing to open-source projects. I founded and currently moderate the [Java User Group in Bangladesh](https://jugbd.org/), organizing meetups and conferences to share Java-related knowledge with the community since 2013. I was named a Most Valuable Blogger (MVP) by [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/1298119/bazlur_rahman.html), one of the world's most recognized technology publishers. Additionally, I serve as an editor for the Java Queue at [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/profile/A-N-M-Bazlur-Rahman/), another leading technology content publisher and conference organizer, and at [Foojay.io](https://foojay.io/today/author/bazlur-rahman/), a platform for OpenJDK enthusiasts. I have also published [five bestselling books](https://www.rokomari.com/book/author/47860/a-n-m-bazlur-rahman) about the Java programming language in Bengali.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Information Technology, with a major in Software Engineering, from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I currently reside in Toronto, Canada.

### JEP 467: Java Enhances Documentation with Markdown Support (2024-05-21)
JEP 467, Markdown Documentation Comments, has been promoted from Proposed to Target to Targeted for JDK 23. This feature proposes to enable JavaDoc documentation comments to be written in Markdown rather than a mix of HTML and JavaDoc @ tags. This will allow for documentation comments that are easier to write and read in source form....

### JEP 476: Simplifying Java Development with Module Import (2024-05-13)
JEP 476, Module Import Declarations (Preview), was integrated into JDK 23. This preview feature proposes to enhance the Java programming language with the ability to succinctly import all of the packages exported by a module, with the goal of simplifying the reuse of modular libraries without requiring code to be in a module itself....

### JEP 474: Generational Mode Now Standard for ZGC in Java (2024-05-03)
JEP 474, ZGC: Generational Mode by Default, has also been targeted for JDK 23. This JEP proposes to use the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) from non-generational to generational mode by default. The non-generational mode will be deprecated and removed in a future JDK release. This will reduce the cost of maintaining the two modes, so future development can primarily focus on Generational ZGC....

### JEP 423: Introducing Region Pinning to G1 Garbage Collector in OpenJDK (2023-12-15)
After its review concluded, JEP 423, Region Pinning for G1, has been Integrated into JDK 22. This JEP proposes to reduce GC latency by implementing region pinning for the G1 garbage collector. This will extend G1 so that arbitrary regions may be pinned during both major and minor collection operations, so that disabling the garbage collection process may be avoided while implementing JNI....

### JEP 457: Streamlining Java Development with the Class-File API (2023-12-06)
JEP 457, Class-File API (Preview), has been Integrated into JDK 22, proposing a new API for parsing, generating, and transforming Java class files. This API will initially replace ASM within the JDK with plans for a public API. Goetz, the Java language architect at Oracle, described ASM as outdated and provided details on the API's evolution....
