In Bangladesh, I was featured in one of the country's most widely read newspapers.
==================================================================================

After being honoured by being given the title of[Java Champion](https://twitter.com/Java_Champions/status/1523728715368509440), I was featured in [Daily Ittefaq (page 12)](https://epaper.ittefaq.com.bd/epaper/2022-06-08/1/1), one of Bangladesh's most widely read newspapers. Seeing my face on the morning news was an honour I didn't take lightly.
