Weekly Java Newsletter -- Issue #3
==================================

Hi there,

I hope you are doing great---Eid Mubarak.

In case you are unaware, it means a blessed festival. We, Muslims, celebrate two major festivals, Eid-ul-Adha being one of them. It was on last Saturday. On this occasion, some of us who are capable financially go to perform the Hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca, and many of us sacrifice animals, distributing the meat to everyone, especially the needy. This commemorates Prophet Ibrahim(Abraham)'s (peace and blessings be upon him) willingness to sacrifice his son. It is a narrative shared by Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.

It is a huge festival. Well, you can see, that's why I only had time to read a few articles this week. But I promise that next week I will do better.

Have fun reading the items.

1. [Java vs. Python: A comparison of machine learning libraries](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-machine-learning-tribuo-python-scikit-learn?source=:em:nw:mt::::RC_WWMK200429P00043C0062:NSL400244550): From the perspective of many developers, Python is the undisputed champion when it comes to machine learning (ML)-related tasks. While such a conclusion is plausible, Java is not lagging behind. This article demonstrates that Java provides libraries capable of performing the same tasks as Python. Therefore, Java developers who wish to implement ML do not need to switch languages.
2. [Jakarta Tech Talk -- Jakarta EE 10 Release Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiLd2uPM9BI): If you missed the Jakarta 10 Jakarta EE 10 Release Celebration, you can always watch it now.
3. [Refactor Switch to a One-Liner -- DZone Java](https://dzone.com/articles/refactor-switch-to-a-one-liner): This article explains how the switch statement is terrible for object-oriented programming and how we can rewrite the code with proper OOP. I felt like this article could be a good refresher on OOP.
4. [Java's Encapsulation -- When the Getter and Setter Became Your Enemy](https://dzone.com/articles/java-encapsulation?utm_campaign=javas-encapsulation-when-the-getter-and-setter-became-your-enemy&utm_medium=social_link&utm_source=missinglettr-linkedin): This is another OOP refresher. When writing code, we should always adhere to the concept of OOP. One of the pillars of OOP is encapsulation, which hides the internal data structure of a class and lets us expose data through getters and setters. Then, we automatically assume that the getter and setter will protect the data from external modification. However, this conclusion is true in many cases but not universal. This article explains how easily getters and setters can become your enemies.
5. [Pattern matching updates for Java 19's JEP 427: when and null](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-pattern-matching-switch-when-null): Pattern machining is a great new addition to the Java language. It is undoubtedly going to reshape how we write code in Java. This article discusses the refinement of pattern matching in [JEP-420](https://openjdk.org/jeps/420), which includes the use of *when* and *null* in the case statement.
6. [Moving Forward With Money-API, JSR 354: Motivation Behind the API -- DZone Java](https://dzone.com/articles/moving-forward-money-api-jsr-354-the-motivation-be): A new money API under [JRS-354](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=354) is being developed. You should certainly read about this API if you deal with money in your code.
7. [Hard things in Computer Science](https://foojay.io/today/hard-things-computer-science/): A saying goes like this: computer science has two hard things: cache invalidation and naming things; and off-by-one errors. Well, this article precisely discusses that.
8. [I've Become a Senior. Now What](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ive-become-senior-now-what-otavio-santana/): This article is not about Java, but I find it important. If you are a senior developer, it discusses your next path.

That's all for today!
