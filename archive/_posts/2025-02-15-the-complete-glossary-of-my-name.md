The complete glossary of my name
================================

A. N. M. Bazlur Rahman.

That's my name. The length of that name is impressive. What I should be called is a point of confusion for most people. Therefore, I usually tell people to address me as **Bazlur**.

The first part of my name is an abbreviation. **Abu Nayeem Muhammad Bazlur Rahman** is the complete form of my name. By definition, I should be referred to as Muhammad.

But somehow, that never happened. The first two words and the last two are essentially adjectives. The meaning of the first two words is "father of comfort" or "one who is fond of ease." Further, the final two words mean "gift from the All-Merciful."

The name **Muhammad** also has its own meaning: the praiseworthy. I wouldn't dare say I'm worthy of praise, but there's no denying how much I enjoy ease and convenience. I'm a super lazy person. They say that people's names can provide clues about their personalities. Mine certainly does resemble my personality, at least in some percentages.

This impressive and lovely name was given to me by my parents, and I am eternally grateful to them.

So, there you have it: a complete glossary of terms relating to my name.
