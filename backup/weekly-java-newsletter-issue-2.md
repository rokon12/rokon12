Hi there!  
I hope you are doing great and done with your morning coffee â˜• well, if this happens to be morning for you. If not, that's okay too. You can always have another cup. After all, we are all Java developers here.

This week I have read some great Java content. Of course, it would be unreasonable if I didn't share it with you all. So take a look at all the fresh brews I have read and loved.

Defiantly it is worth reading.
11. [Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions with Serverless and Kubernetes Native Java](https://www.infoq.com/articles/reduce-CO2-with-serveless/): With the rise of cloud deployment, IT departments consume fewer physical servers and less electric power and eventually help mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions.

> Quick recap: [#JavaEE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaEE?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) was renamed [#Jakarta](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jakarta?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) EE; it transitioned from JCP to Eclipse foundation. It opened the door to open governess, open compatibly testing (open TCK), and of course, open-source.
